# All of the below tools are recommended as they are able to edit the rom directly and are open source. Please respect the various licenses of them.

### DSPRE

AdAstra's DSPRE is the ideal tool for editing the Pokemon DS era roms and is a swiss army knife for editing anything that doesn't require a direct code patch. Download from [here](https://github.com/AdAstra-LD/DS-Pokemon-Rom-Editor/releases/tag/v1.11.1), the only rom patch from this that we use is the Item ID Patch so that we can give ANY item via the Item Balls in game.

### AdAstra's Level Script Editor

Accompanying DSPRE is the Level Script Editor also by AdAstra. This is required so we can have our AP item script run on a trigger on EVERY map in the game when requested. Download from [here](https://github.com/AdAstra-LD/Pokemon-Level-Script-Editor).

### PKHeX

#### IMPORTANT NOTE: This is GPLv3 licensed, therefore using ANYTHING from the source code is strictly prohibited. This is to be used ONLY as a tool.

The swiss army knife of exploring Pokemon save games, this is commonly used to check on what flags are being set by the game after performing an action. We need to know these flags so that AP can be triggered based on it. Download from [here](https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/1-pkhex/), source code [here](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX)
